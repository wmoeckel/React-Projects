            <h2>Open Mics VS Jams:</h2>
            <p>Every one seems to have different ideas about what is meant when people say Open Mic or Jam, so that we are all on the same page here is our deffinitions:</p>
                <li class="list">
                    <p> An Open Mic is an oportunity for you to get up and show your talents by perfoming pieces you have prepared yourself and will likley perform by yourself unless you requested to have someone back you up. This normally takes the form of some one singing and ocompanying themselves with either a piano or acoustic guitar performing originals or covers.</p>

                <li class="list">
                    <p>A Jam on the otherhand is an oportunity to play and perform with other muscisians as a group of muscisians is thrown together and someone calls a tune and often weather or not you know it you are playing it. This often takes the form of enough muscisians to create an ansemble performing well know standards. Often Jams are orientated towards a particular genre such as bluegrass, blues, or jazz. </p>

                <h2>Masters Brewhouse OpenMic</h2>
                <p> Every Thursday from 7:00 pm. to 10:00 pm. ran by Anthony. When you show up talk to Anthony to get on the list where you will get up and perform three songs. This open mic has the type of atmosphere where everyone gets up and acopmanies their own singing by playing acoustic guitar. The Open Mic provides PAs, Mics, and a quarter inch cable to connect your acoustic guitar to the PA.</p>

                <h2>Fired Up Pizza Jam</h2>
                <p>Every Sunday from 2:00 pm. to 5:00 pm. ran by Steve. When you show up there will be a sheet on a table by the door, put your name on it to get in line to perform. Often times Steve doesn't look at the list so it is helpful to go talk to him yourself. This jam is open to all styles of music although largly 70s classic rock tunes get called. The jam has PAs, mics, guitar amps, a place to plug in a bass, a keyboard, and a drum kit so you really just need to bring your own guitar, bass, or drum sticks.</p>
